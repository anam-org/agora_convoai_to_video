# Agora ConvoAI Agent Speech to Video Integration

This repository provides a generic protocol and implementation for external services to receive an AI agent's speech output from Agora's ConvoAI platform, enabling real-time generation of video and publishing both the audio and video back into an Agora channel for low latency, global distribution. This creates interactive experiences such as AI-powered avatars, interactive movies, and other real-time multimedia applications.

## Overview

The integration follows a three-phase workflow:

1. **Connection Setup** - Establish session and obtain WebSocket connection details
2. **Audio Streaming** - Receive real-time audio data from ConvoAI via WebSocket
3. **Video Publishing** - Generate and publish audio/video content back to Agora channel
